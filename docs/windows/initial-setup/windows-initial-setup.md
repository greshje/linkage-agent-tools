This document walks through the exact steps required to successfully install and run link-agent-tools in a Windows environment.  

## Install Docker
Download and install Docker from here:
<br/>
[https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)
<br/><br/>
<b>The install executable must be run as administrator</b>
<br/>
If the install is not run as administrator, some components (including some WL and Linux virtual machine components) will not be properly installed.
